# 16-bit-microprocessor
RISC stored program machine
this machine code is divided in three parts :
1.control_unit
2.processing_unit
3.memory_unit
all units are working together and individually.
this programe code is run under icarus verilog tool in linux so those who dont know how to install Iverilog please follow the step below :-
1. open your terminal using ctrl+alt+t
2. now type sudo apt-get install iverilog
3. now type sudo apt-get install gtkwave 
for running the program code please type iverilog -o run risc.v test_bench.v
after compilation of source code then enter ./run
now you will find a .vcd file now run that file and you are ready to go.




note :- please download all the files on same directory.

note :- i have not given the test_bench file because i am not able to write a stored program in my memory so those who can sort         out please mail me the solution of testbench to devkumardx1995@gmail.com 


mote :- please also mention your feedback and valuable suggestions so that i can improve my code. thank you
